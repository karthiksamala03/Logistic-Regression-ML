# Problem Statement:
The Dataset comprises of data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.
The User has to predict on perticular day is there chance getting froest fire or not based on given features
The Predictions helps in future to tickle Forest fire situations and to make prevention of causing forest fire in future

# Data Collection:
Data Collected from UCI Repository : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Algerian+Forest+Fires+Dataset++
